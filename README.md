[![Dashboard 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/400b6761-4bf8-49ae-a422-9fad38bac85c)](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/swati.roy1784/viz/SeasonalFluShotDashboard2024/Dashboard1)


The main aim of this project is to do an exploratory analysis of 2024 flu shot data in a health care institution. For this, I have generated fictitous patient data and their electronic health records using [Synthea](https://synthea.mitre.org/about). I have used PostgreSQL for processing the data and Tableau Public for creating the dashboard.
